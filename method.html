         <h2>  METHODOLOGY</h2>
        <p>To evaluate the impact of reduced food waste, we created an independent model outside Project Drawdownâ€™s core model framework that projects food consumption and waste from 2020 to 2050. This was required due to the complexity of estimating country- and regional-scale food consumption and waste trends.</p>
    </div>
        <strong>Total Addressable Market:</strong>
    <p>
        We defined the global market for reduced food waste as the total demand for food, based on estimated kilocalories supplied per year for consumption by all of the people in the world. We projected the baseline food consumption for all countries up to 2060 in kilocalories per capita per year, using data compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for 2013. We forecasted future consumption using growth factors from Alexandratos and Bruinsma (2012), which reflect projected dietary changes. The projected dietary changes show significant impacts for countries like India and China, whose populations are expected to demand more carbon-intensive foods over the next 30 years.

    We calculated total food loss and wastage according to regional estimates of waste generated at each supply chain stage (agricultural production, post-harvest handling and storage, processing, packaging, distribution, and consumption; FAO, 2011), applied to aggregated country-level food demand by commodity type. Current adoption of reduced food waste (defined as the amount of functional demand supplied in 2014) is considered to be 0 percent.
    </p>
    <strong>
        Adoption Scenarios:
    </strong>
        <p>
        We calculated impacts of increased adoption of reduced food waste from 2020 to 2050 by comparing two growth scenarios with a reference scenario, in which the market share was fixed at current levels.

Adoption scenarios in this model grow linearly over time starting from the base year of 2014, and are considered complete in 2050. We chose linear growth trends because of the lack of country or regional data; additional behavioral research at more granular scales can reveal more representative adoption estimates.<br>
<br>
            <ul>
<li>Scenario 1: Total global food loss and wastage is reduced 50 percent by 2050.</li><br>
<li>Scenario 2: Total global food loss and wastage is reduced 75 percent by 2050</li></p>
       </ul> 
       <strong>Emissions Model:</strong>
            <p>To estimate emissions, we drew commodity-specific carbon dioxide equivalent per-calorie values from several sources (see Audsley et al., 2010; Heller and Keoleian, 2014; Hoolohan et al., 2013; Tilman and Clark, 2014; Vieux et al., 2012) to estimate minimum, average, and maximum emissions factors per commodity. We multiplied the emissions factors by the baseline annual food demand by country and commodity to get the carbon dioxide equivalent values for food items over time. We aggregated emissions estimates by commodity type (cereals, roots and tubers, oilseeds and pulses, fruits and vegetables, meat, fish and seafood, milk) and regions used by Project Drawdown.

       <br> We applied FAO regional estimates of food loss and wastage by commodity types across the supply chain stages to aggregated emissions values associated with regional food demand. We calculated emissions reductions based on the incremental adoption of reduced food waste, which was applied across all stages of the supply chain. We then aggregated resulting emissions reductions to represent the total global reduction from avoided agricultural production.</p>
    <strong>Integration</strong>
        <p>We calculated the total reduction in food loss and wastage by weight and commodity type. We assumed that reduced loss and wastage can be diverted to feed current and future undernourished populations. We used diverted tonnage of food as an input in our Integrated Yield Model, which combines all agricultural production models to determine the annual yield required to meet the estimated food and bio-based product demand. Results from both demand-side solutions (Reduced Food Waste and Plant-Rich Diets), determine the need to convert land to cropland and grassland to meet future food demand. We applied emissions reductions associated with land conversion to Reduced Food Waste and Plant-Rich Diets solutions according to the proportion of their contribution to diverted food supply. We also applied the results from Reduced Food Waste to solution models in the Industry sector that use organic municipal solid waste.</p>
